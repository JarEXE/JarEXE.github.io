        When not busy at work or refining my software development skills, I like
        to keep active in the gym, study game design, keep up with some of the
        latest tech trends, play video games, watch MMA / Kickboxing, listen to
        good music, and watch anime. I have also been known to dabble in some
        skateboarding.
